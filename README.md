# Discontinous Galerkin

## Introduction

In the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is a widely used high-order numerical method for discretizing partial differential equations (PDEs). In the DG method, the computational domain is discretized into elements, this is referred to as the mesh, and within each element, the solution is locally reconstructed by polynomials of order P. Favourably, the method allows for discontinuities between elements by employing a numerical flux (i.e. an approximate Riemann solver).
